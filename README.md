# maximum-entropy-method (W.I.P)

MEM is commonly employed in astronomical synthesis imaging, which functions by minimizing a smoothness function ("entropy") in an image.
But it can also be used for any kind of geolocation data for generating frequency distribution.
More theory about the method can be found [here][mem]. 

In this repository, will be making a python package for effectively using MEM on geo-location data

To add 
- Data from experiments w/ Green's function

If you have any comments, feel free to reach out to me at nikhilvs999@gmail.com

This is the README file for the project.
